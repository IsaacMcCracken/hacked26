pname is a game engine that uses Scratch-like blocks to design your game!

With pname, you can go directly from high-level abstractions to a dynamically-linked executable.

```mermaid
block
columns 1
  block:development
    columns 1
    block:editor
        block_editor("Block Editor")
        entity_editor("Entity Editor")
        texture_editor("Texture Editor")
    end
    space
    block:output
        preview["Initial Scene Preview"]
        product["Executable Product"]
    end
  end
  editor --> preview
  editor --> product
```
###### With the same code, preview and deploy your game!
