pname is a highly abstracted IDE that uses Scratch-like blocks for embedded system development!

With pname, you can go directly from high-level abstractions to a dynamically-linked executable.

```mermaid
block
columns 1
  block:development
    columns 1
    block:editor
        block_editor("Block Editor")
    end
    space
    block:output
        executable["Executable"]
    end
  end
  editor --> output
```
